Name: Adafruit RFM95W LoRa Radio Transceiver


Price: 19.95


About: LoRa radio receiver/transmitter. Able to transmit 2km-20km based on antenna and obstacles. Probably will be on the low side for us since we don’t have shaped antennas. Don’t know if it plays well with other modules, so just buying 2 for shore and the boat is probably easiest.


Need separate antenna. Documentation is really strong (adafruit) which is nice.
